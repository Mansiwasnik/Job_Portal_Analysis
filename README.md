# Job_Portal_Analysis

## Tableau Project Documentation: Job Portal

### 1. Project Overview:
The goal of this analysis was to assess how many individuals and companies registered
on the job portal, how many people are employed, and identify areas for improvement to
increase user interaction and interest in the website. The dashboard was designed to
present key metrics that would allow us to understand the current state of registrations,
job roles, and employment status while providing insights into how to increase
engagement on the platform.
